                            <h4>Affiliate member</h4>
                                An affiliate shares his/her referral link with friends and family to register on the platform and get information for every successful registration. This feature is open to anybody registered on the platform and has enrolled for at least one course. Once a person registers and enrolls, the affiliate program will be enabled on his dashboard, and he can start inviting his friends to join.
                                The affiliate user gets a bonus for each direct referral he/she makes. The affiliate system also has a multi-level system which is up to the 20th generation. This implies that he/she must get paid when his/her downline refers a person. This is also extended to the 20th generation and therefore generating a passive income to the affiliates.
